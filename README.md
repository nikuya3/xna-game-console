# xna-game-console
A general-purpose in-game console for the [XNA framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA). Refer to the `TestGame` class for exemplary usage. Due to the dependency on Windows libraries for console input, this library is not compatible with [MonoGame](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame).
